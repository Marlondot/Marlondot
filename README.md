### Hi there, my name is Marlon ✨

I'm a Software Engineer with experience in cleansing, clustering, analysis, and classification of data. I am now learning more about backend development with Flask and frontend development with React 🌱.

- ☁️ I've deployed web solutions using S3, RDS, Lambda functions, and EC2 instances, adhering to security best practices like the Principle of Least Privilege (PoMP).
- 🛞 I've worked with Flask to create RESTful web applications, and Pytest to test functionalities.
- ⚙️ I've set up GitHub Actions pipelines for CI testing of web applications.
- 📊 I've been using pandas for data cleansing, seaborn for analysis and visualization, and Scikit-learn for classification, clustering, and data preprocessing.
